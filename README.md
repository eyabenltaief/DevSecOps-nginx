## Lab utility:
#### A simple static analysis (SAST) on a Nginx server Docker image, combined with a Docker scanner (Docker Scout) to identify common vulnerabilities in directories and dependencies.
#### This analysis is integrated into a CI/CD pipeline to deploy the image while applying solutions to fix or avoid critical and high vulnerabilities.
